# serverless-education
Education applications designed to be deployed to AWS Lambda

These example applications are designed to help learners to practice and master new skills. Each application is stateless and can be played without needing to login. Some applications are single-file serverless applications which can be easily copied and pasted into the Amazon Webservices Lambda console. Other applications consist of multiple files and are hosted in their own dedicated repositories. The Demo links point to an example of the application deployed to AWS Lambda.
